# EvoPhylo

A package to perform automated morphological character partitioning for phylogenetic analyses and analyze macroevolutionary parameter outputs from clock (time-calibrated) Bayesian inference analyses.

The ideas and rationale behind the functionality and objectives of the analyses available in this package were first presented and can be referenced to [Simões, T. R. & Pierce, S. E. 2021. Sustained High Rates of Morphological Evolution During the Rise of Tetrapods. Nature Ecology & Evolution.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-021-01532-x)
